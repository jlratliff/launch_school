We use self to specify a certain scope for our program. self can refer to different things depending on where it is used.

So just to be clear, from within a class...

self, inside of an instance method, references the instance (object) that called the method - the calling object. Therefore, self.weight= is the same as sparky.weight=, in our example.

self, outside of an instance method, references the class and can be used to define class methods. Therefore, def self.name=(n) is the same as def GoodDog.name=(n), in our example.
