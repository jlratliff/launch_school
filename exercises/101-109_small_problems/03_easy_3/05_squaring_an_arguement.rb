# 05_squaring_an_arguement.rb
# Using the multiply method from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write a method that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of multiplying a number by itself).

# Example:

# square(5) == 25
# square(-8) == 64

def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
end

def square(num)
  multiply(num, num)
end

p square(5) == 25
p square(-8) == 64

# def square(n)
#   multiply(n, n)
# end
