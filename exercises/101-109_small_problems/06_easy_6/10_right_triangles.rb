# Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

# Examples:

# triangle(5)

#     *
#    **
#   ***
#  ****
# *****
# triangle(9)

#         *
#        **
#       ***
#      ****
#     *****
#    ******
#   *******
#  ********
# *********

def triangle(size)
  stars = size + 1
  (stars.downto(1)).each { |space| puts ' ' * space + '*' * (stars - space)}
end
