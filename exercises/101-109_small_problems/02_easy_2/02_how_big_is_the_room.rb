# 02_how_big_is_the_room.rb

# Build a program that asks a user for the length and width of a room in meters and then displays the area of the room in both square meters and square feet.

# Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

# Do not worry about validating the input at this time.

# Example Run

# Enter the length of the room in meters:
# 10
# Enter the width of the room in meters:
# 7
# The area of the room is 70.0 square meters (753.47 square feet).

puts 'Enter the length of the room in meters'
length = gets.to_i
puts 'Enter the width of the room in meters'
width = gets.to_i

puts "The area of the room is #{length * width} meters " + \
     "(#{(length * width * 10.7639).round(2)} square feet)."

# SQMETERS_TO_SQFEET = 10.7639

# puts '==> Enter the length of the room in meters: '
# length = gets.to_f

# puts '==> Enter the width of the room in meters: '
# width = gets.to_f

# square_meters = (length * width).round(2)
# square_feet = (square_meters * SQMETERS_TO_SQFEET).round(2)

# puts "The area of the room is #{square_meters} " + \
#      "square meters (#{square_feet} square feet)."
